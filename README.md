# Lox Interpreter Written in Zig

Lox is the language described in Robert Nystrom's
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book.
This repo contains a Zig implementation of Lox bytecode compiler,
i.e. the second part of the book.

> [!NOTE]
> Check out <https://github.com/wiseodd/rustlox> for my implementation
> of Lox _interpreter_ (as opposed to the compiler here), written in Rust.
